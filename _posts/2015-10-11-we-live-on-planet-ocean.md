We live on planet ocean.

We call it earth, but 71% of the surface is covered in water, and 96.5% of all water is in the oceans.

Humankind has always lived alongside the sea. Perhaps it is time to move the frontier West once again, to move onto the sea itself.

There is no such thing as a drought at sea, as long as you have sunshine and solar panels. There is no such thing as running out of living space, or hating your neighbors. Floating property costs practically nothing to move, unlike a home on land.

But, "living at sea is expensive, boats are expensive, how would you make a living, how can anyone afford it? It's impractical, what if a storm hits? What about bad weather."

We asked ourselves what would happen if living at sea could be made both affordable and safe, who wouldn't want to live at sea? ![](http://i.imgur.com/nrlf8HU.jpg)
